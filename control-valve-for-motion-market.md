<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Control Valve for Motion Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rotary</li><li>Linear</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Control valves in the motion market are essential for regulating fluid flow and pressure. They are classified into two main types: rotary and linear. Rotary control valves use a circular motion to adjust flow, commonly found in applications like ball and butterfly valves, offering fast operation and compact design. Linear control valves, such as globe or gate valves, utilize a straight movement to manage flow, providing precise control, typically used in applications requiring gradual adjustments. Both types are crucial in various industrial processes.</p></p>
