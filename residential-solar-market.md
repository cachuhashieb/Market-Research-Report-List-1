<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Residential Solar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Grid-Tied Solar System</li><li>Off Grid Solar System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The residential solar market encompasses two primary types: grid-tied and off-grid solar systems. Grid-tied systems connect to the local electricity grid, allowing homeowners to utilize solar energy while relying on the grid for supplemental power and to sell excess energy back, benefiting from lower electricity bills. Off-grid systems, however, operate independently, utilizing battery storage to provide energy in areas without grid access, offering self-sufficiency but often requiring a higher initial investment to cover energy needs entirely.</p></p>
