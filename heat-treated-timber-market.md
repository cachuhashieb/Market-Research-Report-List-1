<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heat Treated Timber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hardwoods</li><li>Softwoods</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The heat-treated timber market comprises two main types: hardwoods and softwoods. Hardwoods, derived from deciduous trees, are known for their durability and strength, making them ideal for flooring, furniture, and high-quality construction. Softwoods, from coniferous trees, are typically lighter and more cost-effective, often used in framing, paneling, and general construction. Heat treatment enhances both types by improving resistance to decay, pests, and warping, thus broadening their applications in residential and commercial settings while elevating their performance and longevity.</p></p>
